# Hello, Pages! Theme


### Easy 1-2-3 Publishing

Thanks to the new plugins for easy publishing, namely
Optional Front Matter,
README Index,
Default Layout, and
Titles from Headings
you can now publish pages, that is, static (web)sites
on GitHub without any configuration (that is, `_config.yml`) or
front matter blocks (that is, `---` ... `---`) in your markdown documents
and your README.md will become the index.html front page of your site.

### Relative Links

Thanks to the Relative Links plugin, you can link to markdown source files
and GitHub Pages automatically changes the link to hypertext (.html) when published e.g.


```
[Page Two](two.md)  
        becomes =>
<a href="two.html">Page Two</a>
```

Try it. Follow along to [Page Two](two.md) or to [Page Three](three.md).
